        <h4>Cities I've lived In:</h4>
        <p>I was born in Houston and moved between the neighboring cities-Tombal and Cypress-as I grew up. Once I moved out on my own I've moved around a bit for work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Houston</li>
            <li>Tomball</li>
            <li>Cypress</li>
            <li>San Antonio</li>
            <li>San Angelo</li>
            <li>Arlington</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cities I Want to Visit:</h4>
        <p>I'd like to visit Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, South Korea because I'd like to experience the regions' culture and food. As for Paris, France, I learned the French language in high school, so it'd be nice to try an immersion experience.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tokyo</li>
            <li>Seoul</li>
            <li>Paris</li>
        </ol>
