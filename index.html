        <h4>Cities I've lived In:</h4>
        <p>I was born in Houston and moved between the neighboring cities-Tombal and Cypress-as I grew up. Once I moved out on my own I've moved around a bit for work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Houston
                <span>I was born and lived here at a young age</span>
            </li>
            <li>Tomball
                <span>I moved here with my parents and started school</span>
            </li>
            <li>Cypress
                <span>We had to move, but chose a nearby home that would allow me to stay in the school district.</span>
            </li>
            <li>San Antonio
                <span>After graduating from high school, I moved here to pursue a career.</span>
            </li>
            <li>San Angelo
                <span>To further my career, I went to San Angelo for an education.</span>
            </li>
            <li>Arlington
                <span>As I progressed through my career, I had the opportunity to move here and gain new experiences</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cities I Want to Visit:</h4>
        <p>I'd like to visit Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, South Korea because I'd like to experience the regions' culture and food. As for Paris, France, I learned the French language in high school, so it'd be nice to try an immersion experience.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Tokyo</em></li>
            <li><strong>Seoul</strong></li>
            <li><em>Paris</em></li>
        </ol>
